it was all a dream i was reading fucked up magazines 
salt and peppa and heavy d up in the limozouine 
hanging pictures on the wall every saturday rap attack









ha sicka than ur average poppa twist
cabbage off instinct niggas dont think shit
stink pink gaters, my detroit players 
timbs from my hoolagans in brooklyn
stand right if they head right big e there every night


to all the ladies in the place with style and grace 
allow me to lace these lyrical dushes in ur bushes 
who rach grovves and make moves moves with all your mommies 
the back of the club singing moppet is where you found me
